This information has been designed specifically for Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) Awards users. Although there are multiple permission levels for users, this guide describes the tasks required for all awards specialists. Topics have also been included to describe some additional views and features available to senior or supervisor users. VBMS is a web-based application designed to support end-to-end claims processing through a consolidated portal. Rather than passing paper from person to person, claims are electronically transferred via the VBMS application, throughout the claim processing lifecycle. Users can log into VBMS internally from the VA network, including connections via the VA’s Virtual Private Network (VPN). Online Help Features VBMS Awards provides a robust online help system, which offers several features that are designed to aid navigation and assist you in finding the information you need. You can access the online help system from the Awards Help link in the Menu bar, available at the top of every screen. You can choose to show or hide a Navigation Side Panel on the left side of your screen by selecting the Show side navigation button or Hide side navigation button. From the panel, you can select the online help topic links, or tab through them and use your Enter key to navigate to areas of interest. In addition to the online help system, the Awards User Guide is available for download as a PDF file. Viewed in Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer, this format offers several methods for finding the information you need, including bookmarks, a table of contents, an index, and search features. PDF Bookmarks Bookmarks are expandable table of contents links that appear by default in the left panel of the PDF file. These links correspond to chapter headings in the guides. You can select the plus sign icon next to the heading to view the subheadings that appear in that chapter. To use PDF bookmarks: 1. Open the guide PDF file. A list of bookmarks is shown in the left panel. 2. Select the plus sign next to the heading you want to expand. 3. Select a bookmark to navigate to that topic. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒5‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Getting Started January 5, 2026 PDF Search Features Acrobat Reader contains search features you can use to find the information you need. To use basic PDF search features: 1. From the Menu bar, select Edit and then choose Find from the list. The Find field is shown in the upper right corner of the PDF viewer. 2. Enter a word or phrase related to the topic you would like to view. Select previous to find information that appears earlier in the PDF, or next to find information that appears later in the PDF. If the text is found, the PDF viewer highlights it. 3. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒6‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) 2 Application Access CHAPTER CONTENTS APPLICATION ACCESS .............................................................................................................. 8 VETERAN RECORD ACCESS .................................................................................................... 8 ADDITIVE USER PERMISSIONS ............................................................................................................. 8 HIGHER LEVEL PERMISSIONS .............................................................................................................. 8 PASSWORDS ................................................................................................................................ 9 PASSWORD STRENGTH .......................................................................................................................... 9 LOGGING IN ................................................................................................................................. 9 SIGNING OUT ............................................................................................................................. 10 TIMING OUT .............................................................................................................................. 11 Awards User Guide: Application Access January 5, 2026 Application Access To access the Awards application, you must receive access credentials based on your user role. User registration and authentication is managed by outside identity providers, such as Common Security Services (CSS). Your supervisor can register for access credentials on your behalf, either with a paper form or by applying electronically in the CSEM system. Requests can be made for a single user with a single role, a single user with multiple roles, or group requests can be made for multiple users with the same user role. After a request is submitted, allow 24 hours for access to be granted. When the registration process is complete, you and your supervisor will receive a user name and a temporary password by email. For security reasons, you must change the initial password when you first log in to the VBMS application. Veteran Record Access When users search for a record in the application, their ability to access and modify that record is determined by a combination of user access rights (also referred to as a role) and the sensitivity level of the record. To support the user roles and sensitivity levels, the application applies policy rules to ensure proper record retrieval. This means only records, search results, claims, contentions, documents, annotations, and participant-identifying data that are classified at a sensitivity level that is equal to or less than the sensitivity level of the user will be shown. If the sensitivity level of the record or item is classified at a higher level, the user cannot view the item. Likewise, application actions are made available based on the role of the user logged into the application. Users cannot modify their own records, the records of their relatives, or the records of VA employees who work with them in the same RO. When these restrictions apply, a message is shown on the Veteran Profile page below the search bar confirming the restricted, read-only access. Additive User Permissions In some cases, users may be granted more than one user role. Permissions will then be additive; this means the role permissions are combined, and the user can access all the information and functions that are allowed for any of the granted roles. Higher Level Permissions Some permissions are enforced at levels above the user role. For example, a user may have the permissions to establish, authorize and award claims. However, users cannot both establish and authorize the same claim, or authorize and award the same claim, due to permissions that are Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒8‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Application Access January 5, 2026 enforced at a higher level – in this case, claim level permissions. Similarly, many user roles can edit claim information, but most non-supervisor users can only do so for claims that have been assigned to them. Passwords When you have received your user name and temporary password, you can log in to the Awards application. You will be required to change your temporary password when you log in for the first time. To comply with VA Directive 6500, passwords automatically expire every 90 days. Users receive a password expiration warning every day for five days before the 90 day period ends. When a password expires, the user must specify a new password on the next log in attempt. Users can also change passwords at any time using the change password check box from the log in page. Passwords used within the last two years cannot be repeated. Password Strength Password strength is a critical component of system security, defined as how well a password resists guessing and brute-force attacks. To ensure the security of Veteran data, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: • Must be eight characters in length • Six of the characters cannot occur more than once (AAAaaa11% is acceptable, but AAAAaaa11% is not) • Must contain three of the four following types of characters: • Lowercase letters (a - z) • Uppercase letters (A - Z) • Arabic numerals (0,1,2,...9) • Special characters as follows, with no : [colon] or [SPACE]: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + { } | " < > ? ' . / [ ] \ - = ~ ` Logging In 1. Connect using a VA approved network, including VA VPNs. 2. Navigate to the following link to launch VBMS in your web browser: https://www.vbms.vba.va.gov/awards Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒9‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Application Access January 5, 2026 3.

Timing Out If your computer remains inactive for 60 minutes, the application automatically times out and any unsaved work will be lost.

To stop the time out and return to the page where you were working, select Stay Logged In. If you do not select OK before timing out, a time out message opens. 3. 4. To continue working, you must log back in.

Each chapter in this guide represents one of the Awards main pages. Multiple views may be provided from main pages using tabs. When tabs are provided, you can select them to switch between the views. Application Functions The VBMS Awards application allows you to: • Search for participants using a File Number or Social Security number (SSN) • View all participants linked to the searched number including the Veteran, family members, fiduciaries, or Power of Attorney (POA) representatives; all beneficiaries of associated awards; and all claimants for associated claims You can also perform the following Awards processing actions: • Add, delete, or review awards • Review decision and award histories • Review award diary entries • Record prior award payments for an award lacking sufficient historical data to process new actions • Generate awards and process Notification information • Review current and proposed awards • Authorize and concur awards • Suspend or resume beneficiaries on awards • Revert awards processing back to the previously authorized award Awards Menu Bar Links are provided in the Awards Menu bar at the top of every page, allowing quick navigation. From the Menu bar, you can navigate to the Home page with the Awards Home link, open the Support Center flyout panel with the Awards Help link, give feedback from the Give Feedback link, and sign out of the Awards application with the Sign Out link. The Menu bar is also a flyout panel, which is open by default when you log into the application. You can close it using the flyout panel control, shown as a grey horizontal bar at the bottom of the flyout. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒13‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Navigating Awards January 5, 2026 Flyout Panels In addition to the Menu bar flyout, the Awards application provides two side flyout panels — the Support Center flyout on the left, and the Tools flyout on the right. The flyout panels open or close when you select the flyout panel controls, shown as grey vertical bars on the left and right edges of the screen. You can also close the side flyout panels with the Close icon, which is shown as a green arrow inside the flyout panel. Support Center Flyout The Support Center flyout, accessed by selecting the Support Center icon or the Awards Help link in the Menu bar, has the following links: • Documentation: contains a button for launching the online help. Tools Flyout The Tools flyout contains buttons for accessing tools and utilities to support awards, as described in Tools Pane. Some buttons in this section may be disabled if there is no current or proposed award for the participant. Bottom Flyout The bottom flyout panel shows the build number, along with the date and time. You can open and close it using the flyout panel control, shown as a grey horizontal bar at the top of the flyout. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒14‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Navigating Awards January 5, 2026 Icon Bar The Awards icon bar is available below the Menu bar, to provide various navigation options and other helpful features. The following icons are available: • Home icon: navigates to the Awards Home page. • VBMS icon: navigates to the VBMS application. • Support Center icon: opens the Support Center flyout, where you can access documentation and contact information for the VBMS Support Desk. • Banner Buttons icon: shows or hides the Awards menu bar. The content section of the page is reduced when the banner is shown. • Context Sensitive Help icon: opens the Awards Help window. • Print Screen icon: opens your browser's Print dialog. • Tools icon: opens the Tools flyout, where you can access tools and utilities to support awards. Column Sorting Many of the VBMS-Awards pages will contain tables or grids of data. In the header row at the top of each grid, each column will have a label describing the contents. Some columns will contain triangle icons. These triangle icons are used for sorting the column contents, and not all columns will provide this ability. The single triangle pointing up or down indicates columns that are already sorted, and in which direction. The double triangles indicate columns that can be sorted. Selecting the double triangles once sorts the column content in ascending order. Selecting the double triangles a second time will sort in the descending direction. For example, if the Added to Gross column is already sorted in the ascending direction (from low to high), a single triangle pointing up will be shown. By selecting that arrow, the column contents will be sorted in a descending direction (high to low) and the arrow will point down. Page Link and Tab Elements The following sections describe some of the common page elements included on Awards main pages. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒15‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Navigating Awards January 5, 2026 Scroll Bars When a page contains too much information to fit onto the allowable page space, scroll bars may appear. Typically scroll bars appear to the right of a data grids, pages or column panels within a page. These would be referred to as vertical scroll bars. Vertical scroll bars appear when there is more data that will fit within the height of a specific page size. These bars become available to allow the operator to move the data up and down and scroll through the items shown. Notice if there are more line items that fit on a page, and the operator uses the right-hand scroll bar to move up and down through the list, any links or features on the left side of the page will not scroll. They will be stationary and available always. Most decision pages will contain this capability. Horizontal scroll bars usually appear if the amount of information on a given page is too wide to fit within the application widow, or the computer screens, width. These bars allow the operator to pan left and right and view the unseen contents. Horizontal scroll bars do not appear as often as the vertical scroll bars, since most pages contain less information than the width of the screen, or the information wraps within the screen size. However, they do appear on occasion and operate in the same fashion. Selecting Options Within the VBMS-Awards pages there may be radio buttons. These buttons allow the operator to choose a single display or filtering option, or one item in a selection list. Like the radio button selection fields, check boxes are also used for selecting different options. When selecting items from a list using a check box, the operator may choose either one or more items in a given list. Typically, when a check box is selected, a check mark will appear which indicates the option is selected. To de- select the same item, the check box can be selected a second time and the check mark will disappear which will indicate the item is no longer selected. Another way of selecting items from a list is by using a drop-down list. When selecting the arrow icon, the operator is given a list of items to choose from. Once one of these items is selected, that item will then appear in the given field. To choose a different item, the arrow is selected again, and a different item is chosen to display in the field. Zoom Controls The following instructions pertain to the IE version 9.0 browser application. However, all browsers contain a similar function. When first accessing the VBMS-Awards application, the IE9 browser window will display the contents in a 100% zoom display. The visual percentage can be found at the bottom of the browser window, as seen below. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒16‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Navigating Awards January 5, 2026 If this percentage value is not displayed, select the View menu and highlight the Toolbars option. Then select the Status Bar option. This will display the bottom bar that contains the zoom percentage function. To change the zoom value, select the drop-down arrow to the right of the zoom percentage value and choose another value. This will display the page contents in a different zoom value, as seen below. The operator may also set a specific zoom value, known as a custom zoom. Select the drop-down arrow to the right of the zoom percentage value and choose the Custom option. This will display a customize dialog. Enter a custom zoom value then select Ok. The window will change views to the entered value. Functional Buttons Several of the Awards pages contain functional buttons that access a specific operation, such as adding new records, or editing existing items, or showing historical information for a selected record, etc. When using a functional button to perform such operations, the button may access a separate page to perform the process. Or it may simply display the action at the bottom of the page for completion. Print Page Contents You can print the currently displayed page contents with the Print icon. If not already selected, choose the correct printer from the list of available printers. 1. Select the Print icon. The Print dialog opens. 2. 3. Select the Preferences button to change any printer settings, if needed. 4. Select the Page Range and Number of Copies options needed. 5. Select the Print button to send the page contents to the printer chosen. Give Feedback From the Give Feedback link, available from the menu bar at the top of any page, you can open a ServiceNow ticket, or submit a feedback survey. The Give Feedback pane opens on the right side of the page. Task Order No: 36C10B21N10070021 ‒17‒ Benefits Integrated Delivery (BID) Awards User Guide: Navigating Awards January 5, 2026 To submit a ServiceNow ticket, select the submit a ServiceNow ticket link.

Depending on your user permissions, Basic Eligibility data may be read-only. ENAD Workspace - Basic Eligibility Decisions When the VA receives notice that a Veteran has returned to active duty, you can use the ENAD Workspace to create a proposed award action that discontinues the benefits during the active duty period of service. This will result in a Return to Active Duty proposal, with the appropriate paragraphs automatically populated in the notification letter to the Veteran. When using the Basic Eligibility page to process an ADL Predetermination Notice Base Template in the ENAD workspace, two award line items are created. The first award line item will populate the Decision and Event Date columns with a decision of Return to Active Duty and the active duty start date for the decision respectively. The second award line item will populate the Decision and Event Date columns with a decision of Eligible Beneficiary and the active duty end date for the decision respectively, unless there is no eligible beneficiary, then the Event Date column will show Unknown. Also, VBMS-Awards will create a “tracked” Basic Eligibility Proposal for each return to active duty decision upon finalization of the predetermination notice when it was first triggered. It will then attach an appropriate enclosure to the ADL Predetermination Notice Base Letter upon finalization.

Because concurrent payment of benefits paid by the VA and the Service Department is prohibited, receipt of military pay by a Veteran must be maintained so that necessary adjustments of the Veteran's VA compensation can be made. There are three ways this information is maintained: • Automated update at claim establishment and at Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) update • Manual retrieval from BIRLS using page functions • Manual entry of the military payment data The information shown on this page does not adjust the benefit in any way. To withhold benefits, you must access the appropriate award adjustment page to enter the dates and balances to recoup. For more information, see Award Adjustments. The adjustment of a proposed award is calculated based on the total retired pay adjustment to determine if the award decision pertains to a "running award." If it is determined to be a running award, the system will recalculate any adjustments automatically based on any newly received data, and will then save the withholding data for the waiver notification of the Veteran’s potential benefits. This processing is shown on the Military Payment information page as well as the Retired Pay Adjustments page. Retired Pay When generating or authorizing an award, the system will retrieve and analyze any cutoff date that might be associated with it. If the award is generated or authorized before or after the retrieved Monthly military retired pay cutoff date, a message is shown indicating that the retired pay amount may be incorrect and/or withheld.
