Deployment date TBD 221 Introduction This document outlines the design for Enterprise Correspondence Management-Letters (ECM-L), a centralized platform that empowers business users to efficiently manage letter content and generation. Currently, multiple Lines of Business (LoBs) within the Veterans Affairs infrastructure use disparate methods and applications to create correspondence, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a heavy dependence on IT support. ECM-L addresses these challenges by providing a unified solution that enables LoBs to self-manage their correspondence needs within a standardized environment. Once onboarded, LoBs can independently make changes—such as updating Letter Templates and Resources—without requiring IT intervention. This centralized approach provides a controlled, reliable environment for producing, testing, releasing, and storing correspondence while streamlining operations and enhancing consistency across all LoBs. What Problem Needs to be Solved? Individual Lines of Business (LoBs) within the Veterans Affairs Organization utilize disparate methods and applications to generate their own correspondence. Without a centralized Enterprise Correspondence Management system, each LoB operates independently for Letter Templates and changes, and any substantial changes to Templates or mandates rely on IT resources for those changes, often requiring customized development for each LoB. This fragmented approach creates resource bottlenecks, operational inefficiencies, and limited historical tracking, ultimately resulting in delays and potential inaccuracies in the correspondence provided to our Veterans. Business Needs Is this a defect or an enhancement? Enhancement Who reported the need? Office of Information & Technology (OIT) When was the need noticed? Q2 2022 When did/will it become a problem? Q2 2024 Is there an existing Requirement? Strategic Objective? What existing resources, tickets, emails, etc. might serve to better understand the problem? What business processes are involved? Who is the business owner for the impacted systems or processes? Enterprise Correspondence Management (ECM) Expansion | BPT-4700 Namespace and Tenant App Request: ECM-L | BPS-74504 Resource Manager API | BPS-69060 Template Manager API | BPS-69063 Letter Manager API | BPS-69064 ECM-L API | BPS-69085 Tenant Security Assessment (TSA) Request under BIP ATO: ECM-L | VBMSD-337002 Document Generation, Document Storage and Retrieval Jeffry Boutet Brian Steege Peter Graziatis Who are the business decision makers for solving the problem? Pam Devine What is the historical context? How did we get where we are? Historically, VA has used multiple applications to generate, manage, and edit letters. Correspondence Service has provided document generation functionality to the VBMS system, providing document generation for use in VBMS Core, Ratings, and Awards. With this architecture, any changes needed by the business specific letter requires large amounts of commitment and OIT resources. What happens to the business stakeholders if nothing is done? Of the various aspects of this problem, which of them does the business consider as critical flaws? Which are nice-to-have changes? Costing Considerations VA will have disjointed efforts and applications for correspondence and letters Need for improvements in Letters Finalization Need for centralized enterprise system that allows multiple LoBs to draft, generate, and Finalize Letters Description Summary of Costs Initial Development Total $8.4M Staffing costs: $7.2M Tools and licenses: $0.7M Training: $8.4M Contingency: $0.2M AWS GovCloud Infrastructure $0.9M / Year Compute: $0.4M / Year Storage: $0.3M / Year Database: $0.1M / Year Networking/Other: $0.1M / Year Annual Maintenance $2.1M / Year Staffing costs: $1.2M / Year Infrastructure updates: $0.3M / Year License renewals: $0.1M / Year Ongoing enhancements: $0.5M / Year 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership $22.4M Development: $8.4M $4.5M Infrastructure: $9.5M Maintenance: ($0.9M Per Year x 5 years) ($2.1M Per Year x 4.5 years) Chargeback Considerations ECM-L creates natural cost separation by organizing all of its components into distinct buckets for each Line of Business (LOB). We will be able to evaluate and isolate usage metrics based on the individual Lines of Business to inform and streamline chargeback considerations. Technical Needs Historically, VA has used multiple applications to generate, manage, and edit letters. This causes numerous workflow inconsistencies, various vendors, and large amounts of OIT commitments and resources, none which seem to have a perfected process in place. The purpose of Enterprise Correspondence Management- Letters (ECM-L) is to create a centralized, enterprise system, built around shared concepts, processes, and workflows to be leveraged by multiple Lines of Business (LoBs) in the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). The system will be LoB oriented, each being responsible for their integration and usage, with BID only supporting, facilitating, and trouble-shooting as needed. Onboarding new LoB will not require development work, but use configurations and system activities. In order to prevent unintended interactions or dependencies, as well as support charge-back capabilities, the content, processes, and data of each LoB will be completely separate from those of another LoB. In addition, the ECM-L will be LoB agnostic, providing reasonable common denominators in concepts or processes among the LoBs, but ECM-L will not contain any proprietary business logic or concepts. Each LoB will be able to integrate and incorporate their own business logic or processes through predefined hooks, APIs, or other integration points. This will allow API access to Letter Instances in data format as well as give LoBs the ability to configure data lookup "callback" to its own systems. The implications of this enterprise system allow for reusing existing concepts in its approach, the opportunity to consolidate and simplify letter generation and management across VBA, and the ability to plan for complexity. Describe the problem in technical terms We need an Enterprise level Line of Business agnostic tool to create and manage correspondence that can integrate with external API's without the need for a code change. What are the architectural components in the problem's context? New tenants: Resource Manager, Template Manager, Letter Manager, ECM-L Service. What are the integration points that might be impacted by this problem? Each of the new tenants will integrate with Line of Business specific API's on an as needed basis. What technologies are involved? Springboot, React, Kafka, iText, Lexical. Is this related to already-stated technical debt? If the problem is with a technology, what were the reasons for using this technology in the first place? Has an attempt been made before to fix the problem? No. N/A No. The existing components in the DocGen namespace were not designed to accomplish this goal / solve this problem and are too entwined with Line of Business specific logic to be repurposed to solve it. Did it fail or did it just not finish? Who are the technical PoCs for that attempt? N/A. N/A. What components are impacted by this problem? -All VA letters/correspondence -Core, Ratings, Awards Are there current mitigations that help alleviate the impact of the problem? No. What are the technical dependencies for this? What does this depend on? What depends on it? The new tenants proposed will stand on their own and external Line of Business specific API's can be configured in as dependencies as needed. Based on the SV-1 and SV-9 generated what is estimated monthly cost for this new service? Upload estimate of resources from the AWS Pricing Calculator TBD Key Concepts and Summary Mission Statement Streamline correspondence management in an enterprise, application-agnostic way, to improve the speed and quality of the communications between the VA and the people it serves. Goals of the ECM-L Ecosystem Reduce redundancy by maintaining all correspondence in a single system Empower the VA by giving them the tools to manage correspondence without developer intervention Allow for changes to correspondence to be published outside of a development cycle / release window Improve the quality of correspondence testing to ensure that our communications are always as accurate as possible Create a platform for integration that can fit seamlessly into existing application and Line of Business workflows Provide stable and reliable content for automated systems in an environment where that content is user maintained The Building Blocks of Correspondence The Basics of Correspondence To generate a piece of correspondence for a Veteran, what is needed? First we need to know what that correspondence should look like. In the ECM-L ecosystem, we call this the for a given piece of correspondence. Template . The Template is similar to a recipe A recipe isn't enough though, we also need the collect these ingredients in what we call a ingredients Letter Instance . A Template may call for and need the name of a Veteran, or their periods of service. We - which represents an "instance" of a given Template. If an example of a Letter Template might be called the "Development Letter", then an example of a Letter." This is a specific piece of correspondence, for a target audience, that is based on the recipe given to us by that Template. Letter Instance would be John Smith's "Development We are able, in the end, to combine the "ingredients" we've collected in the Letter Instance, and the "recipe" contained in the Letter Template, to generate and send out our correspondence, so that John Smith's Development Letter contains all of the pertinent information that he needs. Gathering the Ingredients Sometimes a piece of correspondence requires information specific to the recipient, and there are different sources of that information. Depending on where the information is coming from, and where it "lives," we have a different means of gathering the information for our correspondence. We can separate the information into two categories: Input-Driven Information and Resource-Driven Information. Input-Driven Information (Provided by Users) Any information "given" to the ECM-L components. This can be provided by a human being, via Template-driven dynamic forms in the Letter Manager, or by an automated system, via an API call. All user-provided information is managed in a Template via what we call Inputs. Information Provider Human User Gathering Method Examples Provided through the Letter Manager interface, by a human actor, using a Template-driven Dynamic Form, structured based on the needs of the individual Templates. A Letter Manager user using the Dynamic Form in the Letter Manager to: System User Provided by an automated or system actor via requests to the ECM-L components. Select from a list of VA forms that should be included in the correspondence as Attachments. Select from a list of evidences that should be referenced in the text of the correspondence. Provide the total monthly income for a recipient. An automated system sending a request to the ECM-L API containing: The periods of a Veteran's military service. The nature of a Veteran's discharge. Banking information, such as routing numbers and account types. All user-provided information is managed in a Template via what we call Inputs. Inputs are configured in a Template and can be used within the Template content, and these configurations determine the "shape" of the Letter Instances created using those Templates. When a user accesses the Letter Manager, the Dynamic Form that they use to fill in the missing content is based on the Inputs that were configured in the Template Manager. Resource-Driven Information (Collected from External Services) Any information that the ECM-L components needs to be configured to retrieve itself, by reaching out to external, Line of Business specific services. All user-provided information is managed in a Template via what we call Resources. Information Provider Gathering Method Examples Line of Business Service The ECM-L components must reach out to and retrieve this data from the Line of Business's services on their own, using Connection Configurations and Resources pre-configured by a Resource Manager user. The ECM-L components use a Resource and Connection Configuration set up by users in the Resource Manager to: collect Veteran data from a Participant ID using the Veteran API. First and last name. Final disposition. Gender. collect Claims information from a Claim ID using the Claims API. Claim Type. EP (End Product) Code. Jurisdiction. Combining the Ingredients into Correspondence Once a Template is configured with the right Resources and the right Inputs the ECM-L eco-system can gather the information necessary to generate the correspondence. Reusable Content Most of our Lines of Business will have content such as a shared "header," or a shared "footer," that need to appear the same on all of their pieces correspondence. ECM-L handles this need elegantly by introducing the concept of a configuration of a specific piece of correspondence, Fragment Templates represent re-usable content that can be Fragment Template . Whereas a Full Template represents the full content and included inside of these Full Templates. The Four Major ECM-L Components The ECM-L ecosystem is made up of four sibling components that work together to provide Lines of Business all the tools and power they need to manage and maintain correspondence at a streamlined enterprise level. These components interact with each other via a robust "event" based architecture that allows for external systems to listen for and react to specific events to cover and address needs that are specific to their own use cases, such as the need to generate "Tracked Items" based on content in a Letter Instance as it is Finalized. Name Purpose Resour ce Manager Most of the correspondence we send out includes data that the Lines of Business have already collected. Things like the Veteran's name, their periods of service, their beneficiaries. The Resource Manager allows Lines of Business to create "Resources" that allow us to pull that information in to our generated correspondence. Templat e Manager Letter Manager ECM-L API This is where all of the different correspondence are managed by the individual Lines of Business. Using this tool they're able to update, test, schedule, and publish changes to their correspondence on their own time, using their own unique business processes. Much of the correspondence that gets sent out is user-driven. Users are identifying what type of correspondence should be sent, inputting data relevant to the correspondence, reviewing it, approving it, finalizing it, and sending it out to its intended audience. The Letter Manager is where all of that takes place. There are times when correspondence should be sent out without user interaction. Automated systems like the Pension Automation project or the Automated Document Generation (ADG) project will provide all of the information needed to generate the correspondence of a human user. The ECM-L API is the outward facing "gatekeeper" of the ECM-L eco-system, that these automated systems will communicate with. instead It's also where the PDF rendering engine lives, where we combine the fruits of the Template Manager and the Letter Manager into the actual correspondence. Glossary of Terminology Use this glossary as a guide as you navigate through these documents to better understand some of the core concepts and terms that we use in the ECM- L ecosystem. Key Term Description Changeset A collection of Template-related content that a user wants to publish at a specifically scheduled time. This can include new Template Versions, File Versions, or the retirement of one or more pieces of versioned content. This is the mechanism for managing all of the content within the Template Manager, including creating, testing and publishing, and retiring Template Versions and all other versioned content. A collection of the Configuration information necessary for the ECM-L components to access another system's API so that it's Resources can be used by Templates and Letters. Any information that we want to collect for a Template that will be provided by an external Line of Business specific system instead of being collected directly from a user. These are defined in the Resource Manager and configured by a Line of Business administrator, and the actual data is provided by an endpoint in a Connection Configuration. Connection Configurati on Data Resource Dynamic Form The Template-driven form in the Letter Manager that users utilize to provide information needed for the pieces of correspondence they are working on. This same form is provided to Template Manager users when crafting Test Scenarios that are used to test their content before publication. File Any file-based assets that can be used by a Template such as a PDF or an Image. These live within the ECM-L eco-system and are managed within Changesets in the Template Manager like a Template, as opposed to File Resources which point to Files hosted externally. File Resource File Version Fragment Template A type of Resource used to pull in different file-based assets for use in a Template, such as an Image or PDF. A specific version of a File within the ECM-L. Template that represents a piece of re-usable content that can be included inside of another A useful way to handle things like common headers and footers. A Fragment own. Template cannot be instantiated as a Letter Instance on its Template . Fragment Templates are a Full Template The structured layout and all necessary components, including configuration information (e.g., resources, input types, conditions, restrictions, attachments, etc.) and content required to create a Letter Instance. Image Label Legacy Correspon dence Manageme nt Letter Instance Letter Instance Metadata Line of Business Major Version Minor Version A graphical File that can be inserted into Template content and rendered with a Letter Instance as a part of the PDF. Concise descriptive tags used by Changeset Editors to categorize and organize Template s. All of the different legacy methods that the different Lines of Business used to manage their correspondence, that the ECM-L ecosystem seeks to replace, consolidate, and streamline. Letter Instances point to a specific Template Version and represent all of the information the Template requires for the generation of correspondence. ECM-L can return a Letter Instance as JSON data for situations where a Line of Business needs to evaluate that data or render it as a PDF. A subset of the data related to a Letter Instance that helps a user differentiate it from other Letter Instances, but that does not contain any data collected from Resources or users, and can not on its own produce a generated PDF. Contains information such as the name of the Template that Letter Instance was created for, and the date was created. An organizational segment of operational and strategic activities. Each of the Templates and Changesets belong to a Line of Business. The Major Version of a Template is the number that precedes the decimal. For Version "3.2", the Major Version is "3". The Minor Version of a Template is the number that follows the decimal. For Version "3.2", the Minor Version is "2". Any new Version of a Template that only updates the Template's Content, becomes a new Minor Version of the Template. PDF Portable Document File, a type of File that can be used by a Template as an Attachment. Resource Content that needs to be retrieved from a Connection Configuration, which allows the ECM-L components to communicate with outside systems. There are Data Resources which cover any data that might be returned by one of these systems and File Resources that represent file-based assets. Retirement Action Retirement Actions point to versioned content such as a File Version or a Template Version and upon publication will retire that specific version of that content. (See Retirement ) Template A versioned representation of a type of correspondence, potentially containing reusable content such as Fragment Templates and contextual data provided by Data Resource placeholders, necessary to successfully instantiate and render a Letter Instance. Templates belong to a specific Line of Business. There are two types of Templates - Full Templates and Fragment Templates. Template Version Terminal State Test Scenarios Workflow A specific version of a Template, composed of a combination of a Major and Minor Version number. If the Major Version of a Template is "3", and it's Minor Version is "2", then the Version is "3.2"., composed of a combination of a Major and Minor Version number. A state that an element of the ECM-L system can enter into it that indicates user activity for that element has ended, such as a Letter Instance entering into the DELETED or CANCELLED or FINALIZED state, from which it can not return. Test Scenarios are a way for Template Manager users to create sets of sample data that can be used to create example PDF's using the Templates they've created so they can confirm they are working as expected before publication. Users can add any number of Test Scenarios to a Template Version in a Changeset to test out the different permutations of the content based on different example data. The LoB-specific business process context in which the Letter Manager MFE operates by organizing and categorizing Full Templates and associating specific Key Parameters required for letter generation. An example of a workflow might be, "Developing a C&P Claim," or "Rating a Disability." It describes what we're doing and the purpose of the related correspondence generation. Other Important Concepts Letter Instance Archival Why do we need Letter Instance archival? This tiered storage approach optimizes costs by matching storage expenses to access patterns - keeping frequently accessed letter data in fast, moderately-priced S3 storage while moving rarely accessed historical records to cost-effective Glacier archiving, while maintaining compliance with VA record retention policies and keeping the transactional database lean and performant. How long before a Letter Instance is archived? Letter Instances will be archived based on the Line of Business configuration - by default, it will transition into Archived status after 60 days. Lines of Business can request that this default configuration be overridden to a custom number of days instead. How do we handle Letter Instance archival? Letter Instances that have entered a audits are most likely, and will then be automatically migrated to Amazon Glacier storage after a configurable retention period that varies by Line of Business based on their specific regulatory and operational requirements. This configuration of the retention period takes place during the Line of Business intake process and updating the configuration is managed through a Change Request. will be stored in an S3 bucket for immediate access during the active period when reprints, disputes, or Terminal State Letter Instance Metadata The ARCHIVED state, which will allow them to file a ticket, if necessary, to move the rest of the Letter Instance data back from Glacier so that it can be accessed again. will remain and users within the Letter Manager will be able to see that the Letter Instance exists and was moved into the Retirement Why do we need the concept of Retirement in the ECM-L? The idea behind Retirement is that different Lines of Business will have different business processes that outline how a specific piece of correspondence, such as a Letter Template, might be discontinued. Based on the need for an enterprise level solution that is business agnostic, we've adopted a Retirement philosophy that allows for these LOB's to come up with a plan to discontinue and / or replace a Template on its own time, using its own business processes. When a LOB decides they no longer want a specific version of a Template to go out to its audience, they can have their users go in and Retire that Template Version. Now that it has been Retired, the Line of Business can rest assured that no new Letter Instances will be created based on that Template – it has in effect been turned "off" and is no longer available for use. What happens when something gets Retired? Once an element of the ECM-L ecosystem has been Retired , it can no longer be used for anything new . It no longer appears for selection in any lists that would include it as an option, and no new items can be created using that item – however, any pre- existing configurations or places that already made use of the retired item will continue to function just as before. This ensures safety and continuity for current configurations while preventing the use of outdated or deprecated options moving forward. Item Retirement Impact File Version New Template Versions can no longer be configured to use this File Version - it is no longer available for use inside of the content of a Template in the case of Images, or as an attachment in the case of PDF's. Existing Template Versions already configured with this File Version can continue to use it as before. Key Parameter New Resource Versions and Workflows can no longer be configured to use this Key Parameter - it does not appear in the list of available Key Parameters. Existing Resources and Workflows already configured with this Key Parameter can continue to use it as before. Resource Version New Template Versions can no longer be configured to use this Resource Version - it does not appear in the list of available Resources. Existing Template Versions already configured with this Resource Version can continue to use it as before. Template Version Workflow Connectio n Configura tion New Letter Instances can no longer be instantiated using this Template Version. Existing Letter Instances instantiated from this Template prior to its Retirement can still be worked and viewed as before. New Letter Instances can no longer be created within this Workflow. Existing Letter Instances created before the Workflow was Retired can still be worked and viewed as before. New Resource Versions can no longer be configured to use this Connection Configuration - it does not appear in the list of available Connection Configuration(s). Existing Resource Versions already configured with this Connection Configuration can continue to use it as before. How does ECM-L handle Template Versions with Retired components / dependencies within a Changeset? A Template Version cannot be marked as Completed while it contains Retired components / dependencies. After completion, the Template Version has moved passed the gate, so to speak. If after it moves through that gate, into the Completed status, something it uses is Retired, we will allow the Line of Business to continue to move it onwards through to Publication, but will alert those viewing the Changeset that it's using Retired components along the way. This way the Line of Business can decide if they want to send the Template Version back to Draft so that those Retired components can be removed, or move forward with the Publication anyway. While a Template Manager user is in a screen where they are Testing, Approving, or Scheduling a Template Version for Publication, a warning banner will appear if it is using Retired Components. Versioning Versioning of Material Versioning the material managed in the Template Manager allows us to see exactly which ingredients were combined to create a given piece of correspondence. By maintaining a running historical record of all of the versions of these materials we can recreate correspondence today exactly as it was created yesterday, allowing us to compare changes against old versions and audit historical data when necessary. Major and Minor Template Versions When a user is modifying a Template, there are certain non-breaking changes that are superficial and cosmetic, such as fixing a typo, and there are deeper changes, breaking changes, that alter the shape of the Letter Data in ways that could cause problems for downstream systems. We help to mitigate this and identify when a user is making a breaking or a non-breaking change. For breaking changes, the new version of the Template is given a new Major Version. For non-breaking changes, the new version of the Template is given a new Minor Version instead. Prior to the Changeset being marked as Approved, the version number for the Template Version will be set to and rendered as "TBD" (To Be Determined). Template Version Duplication and "Restoring" Retired or cancelled Template Versions When a user is creating a new Template or Template Version they're able to choose an existing Template Version to base it on – giving them the ability to duplicate Template content, restore Retired content, and to improve the speed at which they can manage and deliver new correspondence. Certain content may not be able to copy over into the new Template Version – for example, if the version we want to copy from contains a Retired Data Resource, we will not be able to pull that Data Resource in to our new Version, and any usages of the Retired Data Resource may need to be cleaned up by the Template Editor. New Template Versions Users in the Template Manager are able, when creating a new Template Version, to base that new Version on any of the pre-existing Versions of the Template that they so choose. The user is even able to choose Versions that had been Retired. By default, the new Template Version will be based on the last Version that was published, but if they wanted to create a new Version based on a Version that pre-dates that, the user can choose to do that. Completely New Templates They are also, when creating a completely new Template, able to base that on a Version of an already existing Template – which gives users the power to make copies of Templates, or base a new Template on one that already exists. Changeset Locking Templates that are actively being worked on in a Changeset are essentially "Locked" and cannot be used in other Changesets. When a Changeset is in a Non-Terminal State, the Templates in that Changeset are "Locked" and can only exist in that single Changeset and cannot be included in any new Changesets until that Changeset is either cancelled or Published. "Terminal" Changeset States: cancelled Published Workflows What is a Workflow? A Workflow answers the question: Why are we sending out this correspondence? The user can indicate that they are "Developing a Claim," or "Rating a Claim," or "Awarding a Claim," and we can cater the Templates available to them based on that chosen Workflow. These relationships between Full Templates and Workflows are managed in the Template Manager so that ECM-L users are empowered to control those relationships on their own. When a Letter Manager user goes to create a piece of correspondence, the first thing they need to do is choose from a list of optional Templates to base that Correspondence on - the Workflow they are in will help to shape that list of options, so that they're only shown options that are relevant to what they are currently trying to accomplish. Example This diagram illustrates the relationship between Workflows and Full Templates within a Line of Business. Full Templates A, B, and C, are aligned to Workflow A1, so a user accessing the Letter Manager through that Workflow will be able to choose from those Templates when creating a Letter Instance. Even though Full Template D is a part of the same Line of Business, since it is not aligned to Workflow A1, it will not appear in the list of available Templates for that Workflow. Line of Business Workflow Available Template s A A1 A2 A3 A, B, C C, D, E, F None System Actors and Automated Activities The ECM-L components provide the perfect platform for Lines of Business to integrate with for any sort of automated letter generation needs. Automatic Letter Generation The ECM-L API provides an interface that your systems can use to interact with the ECM-L components as if they were a human end-user. Systems are able to Create a Letter Instance, and Finalize a Letter Instance, and even to run a Letter Instance all the way through its lifecycle from Creation to Finalization in a single request. Auto-Finalize / Fast-Tracking System Actors can use the ECM-L API's "createLetterInstance" with the "autoFinalize" flag set to true in the request to in one action create a Letter Instance and move it all the way through to Finalization. This is for Systems that want to create a Letter Instance and get a PDF without user interaction. They would first hit this "createLetterInstance" endpoint which would result in a Finalized Letter Instance, and then they would hit the ECM-L endpoint to Render the Letter Instance as a PDF ("renderLetterInstance"). Other System Actor Activities An external system may want to take other actions within the ECM-L components based on user interaction in their own system, or on something else like a rules engine, and all of that is possible via the ECM-L API as well. All of the operations in the ECM-L API are available for use by System Actors. Eventing The ECM-L components emit Kafka Events as actions are taken throughout the system. When a Letter Instance is Finalized, for example, an event is emitted that indicates this has happened. A Line of Business system can be updated to listen for those Finalization Events and to take actions that will be triggered when those Events take place. Because we've provided these enterprise tools for the Lines of Business to handle these things on their own, specialized LOB-specific behavior no longer constitutes development work and code changes within the ECM-L components, and all of these changes occur within those external components instead. Eventing Use Case Example A Line of Business needs to create something called a "Tracked Item" based on the Letter Data that was entered in by its Letter Manager end-users, anytime a Letter is Finalized. They can update their system to listen for Letter Finalization Events and have their system hit the ECM-L API's "getLetterInst ance" endpoint to get the Letter Instance data. Their system can now get the information from the Letter Instance data and use that to create their Tracked Items. Examples of Events The Eventing framework is robust and we essentially produce an Event for any life-cycle change for any element within the ECM-L components. This allows for Lines of Business to automate specialized activities based on any changes to their Templates, Letters, and other content. d The Lifecycle Diagrams elaborate on the Element-specific Events that exist, but here are some examples: Connection Configuration Published Event Key Parameter Type Retired Event Changeset Submitted for Approval Event Template Version Retired Event Letter Instance Finalized Event Style Guide and Special Characters Style Guide The underlying stylesheets and the styling / formatting options provided to Template Manager users to create documents generated by the ECM-L components are based on the VA Style Guide. There is no way to update or deviate from the provided styling options without an enhancement and development time to address it. For more information about the VA Style Guide, see here: 2019 VA Style Guide . Special Characters The content of Correspondence can be complex and can require special characters that other more normalized data inputs allow. For the ECM-L components we have created a whitelist of special characters that are allowed and have outlined situations in which those allowable characters might change or vary. Any updates to this list of acceptable special characters will require an enhancement and development time to address. Navigate here to view the details about which Special Characters are allowed: Special Character Allowances in the ECM-L Components . JSON Path Expression Examples He is a list of some example JSON Path expressions, which our users would use during the configuration process for a Data Resource, for example.

ZonedDateTime to provide a single global In the UI's, and in the generated PDF's, when these dates are presented to an end user, they are displayed for the "ET" time zone, also known as the "America / New York" time zone, to comply with VA standards and guidelines. History and Audit Trail Tracking Comprehensive timestamped history tracking across all three management systems allows us to maintain an audit trail of user activities and system changes that take place in the ECM-L components. In the Template Manager, the system maintains a historical record of all the Changesets and versioned content those Changesets manage, with a historical view that tracks their movement through their various lifecycles. Similarly the Resource Manager and Letter manager maintain a timestamped historical record of the content they manage. These historical records outline when a change was made, a description of the change, and who made it, creating a comprehensive audit trail that supports operational troubleshooting and regulatory compliance requirements. System Level Key Parameter Types While our goal is to keep the ECM-L components business level logic and concept agnostic, allowing for individual Lines of Business to define the shape and content of their correspondence and the resources those pieces of correspondence use, to provide certain pieces of functionality we are required to introduce certain System Level concepts that are shared across the VA. Changes to the VA's use of these Key Parameter Types could require development intervention, since there are ECM-L components designed specifically to work with them. System Level Key Parameter Type Participant ID Reason for Inclusion The Participant ID is a common thread across most of the Lines of Business and more importantly is required to support Claim Evidence and Package Manager functionality. New Name Uniqueness To prevent ambiguity, confusion, and avoid conflicts, we enforce name uniqueness restrictions throughout the ECM-L components. In a general sense, names for things must be unique. These restrictions apply whenever a new name is being decided, through the creation of something new, or through the renaming of something that already exists. New Name Type Template Version New Name Uniqueness Restriction Details Must not match any current Template Name or ACTIVE / DRAFT status Template Version Name within the same Line of Business. Resource Must not match any existing Resource Name within the same Line of Business. Input Must not match any existing Input Name that is a sibling of this input. So if at the root level of a Template, there must be no other Inputs with that name at the root level, or if in an Input Group, there must be no other Inputs with that name in the Input Group, etc. Workflow Must not match any existing Workflow Name within the same Line of Business. Must not match any existing System Level Key Parameter Typeor any Key Parameter Type Name within the same Line of Business. Key Paramete r Type Solution Space and Discussion The solution space describes the architectural context related to the problem/solution in a 4+1 style document. A 4+1 Design is a human-readable, standardized way of viewing an architecture from multiple perspectives. Each perspective is complementary, offering a different way to look at a particular architecture. Taken as a whole, a 4+1 Design is a comprehensive way to communicate an architecture. Use Case View Capability Viewpoint Vision (CV-1) (VASI Description) Enterprise Correspondence Management - Letters (ECM-L) will reside on the Benefits Integration Platform as a Service (#2295) and is under the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS #1728) Product. ECM-L is an enterprise-level system that streamlines the process of managing letter templates and generating letters across the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). It is accessible to multiple Lines of Business (LoBs) and allows each one to independently manage their own templates and generate correspondence from drafts through finalization. ECM-L can be integrated into the business logic of each LoB’s systems through APIs, predefined hooks, and other integration points, as its ecosystem is LoB-agnostic and highly extensible.

Primary Systems High Level Operational Viewpoint (OV-1) The diagram below is a high level overview of the main architectural components of ECM-L and the functions they facilitate in the value stream. The first section of the value stream, the intake process, starts as a Jira ticket. This section consists of mainly manual processes provisioning space and storage, establishing user access requirements, and integrating with external systems. At this point in the process Line of Business (LoB) data needs will be identified and API connections will be established to accommodate those needs. The ECM-L LoB Business User Processes box consists of two main values; creating Resources and creating Templates. Resources are assets that will point to LoB Data using the established API connections to populate Letter Instances as needed. The ability to create, test, and manage Resources is realized by the Resource Manager. Creating and managing Templates, or Letter Templates, is realized through the Template Manager. The ECM-L LoB End User Processes box represents end user interactions with the system to instantiate Letter Instances generated from Templates and populated by user Inputs and Resources. LoB System Processes encapsulates the ability to access, store, and send Letters as the LoB sees fit. Access to the Letters is capable through the ECM-L API. System (VASI) System Item Interaction ECM-L (3000) ECM-L (3000) ECM-L (3000) ECM-L (3000) Resource Manager Template Manager Letter Manager ECM-L API Uses the LoB connection to create and manage Resources. Creates and Manages the LoB Templates. Creates and Manages the LoB Letter Instances. Accesses the LoB Data and Letters for the LoB. Letter Instances are able to be stored in Claim Evidence and distributed via Package Manager. VEFS (3023) Claim Stores the Finalized PDF related to a claim. PacMan (2993) Evidence Package Manager Creates a package for mail distribution. LoB System LoB System Uses its connection to establish Resources, Templates and populate Letter Instances with the appropriate data and access the Finalized Letter Instances. Logical View The Logical View describes the conceptual view of the functionality and of the systems that will participate. This view defines what nouns are involved and the relationship between them. For example, it may decompose the design into sub-systems and packages, and for significant packages, the decomposition into classes and class utilities. This section may include the Business Object Model, states and transitions for key objects, and other key details about classes and attributes.

State Transitions (OV-6b) The following diagrams map out the various states of being for individual ECM-L elements and the flow patterns between those states, as well any events that are triggered as these elements transition from one state to the next. These state transition diagrams represent the "heartbeat" of the ECM-L ecosystem and are grounded in an event-based architectural philosophy. Lifecycle Interactions and Availability This diagram helps to outline the concept of AVAILABILITY and how the different elements of the ECM-L components relate to one another in their Lifecycles. Before an element of one of the ECM-L components is ready to be consumed and used, it must be made AVAILABLE. Once a Once a Once a Connection Configuration Resource Version Template Version is made AVAILABLE by a user, it can be used to create a new DRAFT Resource Version . is made AVAILABLE by a user, it can be used in the configuration of a new DRAFT is made AVAILABLE by a user, it can be used to create new DRAFT Template Version. Letter Instances . Resource Manager Elements These are the lifecycle diagrams for elements belonging to the Resource Manager. Connection Configuration Lifecycle Connection configurations are entered into the system via an intake process through Jira, and then a user is able to move them through their lifecycle in the Resource Manager. Jira Realm These are not statuses that would surface within the ECM-L eco-system because they represent activity outside of it. Events do not take place here since these activities are not a part of the ECM-L components. INTAKE Dev Ops is processing the necessary intake documentation submitted by a Line of Business (LoB) to configure the ECM-L eco-system to interact with and integrate with the API submitted for the Connection Configuration.

Resource Version Lifecycle Resource Versions are managed in the Resource Manager and can be worked on while in DRAFT, and then explicitly made AVAILABLE by a user when they are done. If a Resource Version is still in DRAFT it can be DELETED, and if we want to stop using one after it has been made AVAILABLE, we can move it to RETIRED.

Template Manager Elements These are the lifecycle diagrams for elements belonging to the Template Manager. Changeset Lifecycle Changesets are worked on while they are in a DRAFT state, and then can be moved to READY FOR TEST, where their content can be tested. Once all the testing is complete, they can be submitted for approval, moving them into the READY FOR APPROVAL state. After that they can be APPROVED, and then SCHEDULED for publication. Once the configured scheduling date arrives, the SCHEDULED Changeset is moved to PUBLISHED by the system, and its content becomes AVAILABLE for use. DRAFT This Changeset has been created, named, and work has begun to prepare it for publication. During this state, Templates are being created, added/removed to/from the Changeset, and tested. During this state the Changeset and its content remain modifiable. Test Scenarios can be created and executed to allow for incremental testing of a Template, but can not yet be marked as PASSED. If a user has both the Changeset Editor and Changeset Publisher roles, they cannot mark their own Changeset as APPROVED.

Letter Manager Elements These are the lifecycle diagrams for elements belonging to the Letter Manager. Letter Instance Lifecycle Letter Instances begin in the DRAFT state, and will remain there while they are being modified by a user. When a user is happy with their modifications they can submit it for READY FOR REVIEW, and then after review and approval, it can be moved to FINALIZED. With the right permissions, users are able to bypass the READY FOR REVIEW state, to accommodate automated and system users that need to generate correspondence without human intervention, as well as Lines of Business that do not have an approval process for Letter Instances. As a part of our archival process, the Letter Instance can move into the ARCHIVED state. (See Letter Instance Archival .)

Logical Data Viewpoint Model (DIV-2) The following diagram defines relationships between data elements, providing a structured representation of data flows, entities, and attributes. Physical Data Viewpoint Model (DIV-3) N/A Transitioning Concepts From Legacy Correspondence Management This section visually translates the reimagination of terms from legacy correspondence management applications into ways easier to consume within ECM- L. ECM-L reduces the complexity and learning curve for new users by consolidating fragmented concepts into elegant, intuitive abstractions that leverage planned architectural complexity behind the scenes, reducing difficult operations to point-and-click activities and transforming technical complexity into a streamlined and simplified user experience. High Level Concept Changes Low Level Concept Changes Claim Evidence and Package Manager Integration All Lines of Business are encouraged to use Claim Evidence for document storage and Package Manager for correspondence distribution. What Are Claim Evidence and Package Manager? Claim Evidence and stored within Claim Evidence. Package Manager is a system that manages and stores documents related to a specific Veteran is a system that allows for the mailing and distribution of the documents Lines of Business are able to configure specific Workflows to use Claim Evidence and / or Package Manager, and if they have opted to use them, they are able to override those configurations for specific types of correspondence. Package Manager Distributions Packages created by the ECM-L components are NOT automatically sent, but are ready for review within the Package Manager interface. This is allows for the user to confirm and validate all of the information before sending the packages out to their distribution lists. Workflow Configuration Line of Business Administrators are able to configure their Workflows so that they function in specific ways. Key Parameter Types Workflows should be configured with one or more Key Parameter Types. These will help shape the list of Letters a user is presented with when they access that Workflow in the Letter Manager. Example: Workflow Name: Developing a Claim Key Parameter Type: C&P Claim ID In this situation the Letter Manager user would be, within this workflow, looking at a list of Letter Instances that relate to a specific C&P Claim ID. Storage and Distribution Users can configure a specific Workflow to use Claim Evidence for document storage. For any Workflows that have been configured to use Claim Evidence, they can optionally configure them to create packages for them in Package Manager. Any Workflow that is configured to use Claim Evidence will require the system-level "Participant ID" Key Parameter. In addition to this, each Template must be assigned a Workflow-level Claim Evidence Document Type, and the user will not be able to save a Workflow configured to use Claim Evidence if there are any Templates with an unassigned Claim Evidence Document Type (Unless that Template is marked as Claim Evidence Exempt, which means it doesn't need a Claim Evidence Document Type.) Package Manager Requires Claim Evidence You can not use Package Manager without Claim Evidence, because Package Manager only creates packages of documents that are already in Claim Evidence. Template Association Workflows have a list of Templates (Templates, not Template Versions), that are associated to them. This represents the list of Templates that a Letter Manager is able to create while within that Workflow. Each of the Templates in this list can be configured, at the Workflow level, to be Claim Evidence or Package Manager exempt, which would prevent them from being sent to Claim Evidence or Package Manager. These options will appear conditionally, depending on the configuration of the Workflow as a whole. Document Type For Workflows configured to use Claim Evidence storage, Templates must be configured with a Claim Evidence Document Type, unless they are marked as Claim Evidence Exempt (see below). Claim Evidence Exempt For Workflows configured to use Claim Evidence storage, Templates can be configured as Exempt from Claim Evidence, which means that even though the Workflow is configured to store the PDF of the Finalized Letter in Claim Evidence, that specific Template will not be stored. Package Manager Exempt For Workflows configured to use Package Manager distribution, Templates can be configured as Exempt from Package Manager, which means that even though the Workflow is configured to distribute the stored PDF via Package Manager, that specific Template will not be distributed. Intake Initial Evaluation The initial evaluation during the intake process will evaluate how the Line of Business intends to interact with the ECM-L components, or in situations where the Line of Business is migrating from another correspondence management system, will evaluate how it currently interacts with that. Based on this evaluation the ECM-L team can help to outline a strategy that adapts their intended and expected needs, creating a plan for them to interact with the ECM- L framework. Factors to consider during the evaluation include: Integration Points - An evaluation of when and how Lines of Business systems could and should interact with the ECM-L components to provide the best user experience. Are their steps in the process that are not initiated by a user? Do the Lines of Business systems need to process Finalized Letter Data for post-Finalization work? Is there a need to embed the Letter Manage MFE in one of the Line of Business system interfaces? Letter Migration - An evaluation of specific pieces of correspondence, providing advice on how to adapt those in terms of the ECM-L Template framework. Security and Roles - An evaluation of any Line of Business specific security policy needs. Line of Business Intake The intake process for a new Line of Business involves an ECM-Line of Business Intake Form, which outlines how the new Line of Business interacts with ECM-L system and its components, and identifies any Connection Configurations the Line of Business wants to include in the intake process. Line of Business Intake Form Enterprise Correspondence Management - Line of Business Intake Form The Line of Business will submit the Line of Business Intake Form, and Connection Configuration Intake Form if needed, and create a Jira ticket. After submission of the Intake Form(s), there will be an Integration Meeting with stakeholders to introduce ECM-L capabilities, integration points and connection configurations. Intake Processing This form ultimately results in the configuration information being loaded in to the Config repo for the Resource Manager where it becomes accessible to the rest of the ECM-L components. System Registry As a part of the Intake Process the ECM-L team will determine if the Line of Business will need to interact with the components with a non-human system actor, for processes that are automated. We need to collect enough information to contact Lines of Business to inform them of when Major Changes to a Template they use could necessitate changes to their downstream systems. Information we'd need to collect from them: System Name Points of Contact Name Email Address We will use this registry to alert users to actions that could negatively impact downstream systems so that they can take action to coordinate with the necessary teams to prepare for those changes. For example, if a new version of a Template is marked as Approved during the Changeset approval process, and that Template is known to be generated by a registered system, the user will be alerted. Connection Configuration Intake The connection configuration intake process results in a successful integration between the ECM-L applications and an external Line of Business API. This process begins with a Connection Configuration Intake Form filled out by the Line of Business, which results in a Change Request that loads the necessary Secret / Issuer key pair into the external API and into the individual ECM-L components, and ultimately ends with a Connection Configuration in the Provisioned status, ready to be used. Connection Configuration Intake Form Here is an example Change Request ticket that can be cloned in Jira: BPS-66120 Getting issue details... - STATUS . The Connection Configuration intake form for a new LoB requesting connection to ECM-L will require the following: Line of Business Point of Contact Name Email Address Connection Name Integration Information Vault Secret Locations URL User Roles and Permissions / Intake ECM-L has a robust and well organized system for dealing with Line of Business specific user permissions and roles. For more information, see: ECM-L User Accounts and Permissions . Process View ( Business Process Model) The Process View describes the behavior of the systems, the sequence of events, and how various tasks combine to the functionality described in the Use- Case View. It decomposes the systems into lightweight processes (single threads of control) and heavyweight processes (groupings of lightweight processes). The Process View describes how systems interact, detailing the timing of messages or events. Main Business Process Model (OV-6d) Intake Processes The following diagrams delineate the key processes and workflows within ECM-L, mapping the sequence of activities and information flow that drive operations. Connection Configuration Process Workflows Process Workflow for Connection Configuration Intake This process guides the intake and integration of new connections. It includes submission, approval, configuration, and confirmation across multiple systems. Task Description Start Intake Process Initiate the process for a new connection configuration request. Submit Connection Configuration Intake Form Create Change Request for External API Integration Submit Change Request to Release Management Resource Manager submits the intake form to begin provisioning. Dev Team creates a change request for required API integration. Dev Team submits the change request for approval and release tracking. Approve Change Request Release Manager reviews and approves the submitted change request. Mark Change Request as In Progress Release Manager (or Dev Team) marks change request as actively being worked on. Make Corrections to Change Request Dev Team revises the change request as needed based on feedback or errors. Create and add secret/issuer values (ECM Vault) Add secret/issuer values to ECM application vaults Merge in PR to provision new Connection Config Confirm Successful Integration External Vault team generates and adds secret/issuer values for ECM applications. ECM Vault team updates ECM application vaults with the required secret/issuer values. Resource Manager merges pull request to provision the connection configuration. Various teams (Resource Manager, Ledger Manager, ECM API) confirm that the integration was completed successfully. Integration Successful? Confirmation step checks if integration was successful; if not, process returns to correction steps. Make Connection Configuration Available Once integration is successful, configuration is made available for use. Connection Configuration is AVAILABLE The configuration is fully provisioned and available for business needs. Make Connection Available The Line of Business Administrator is able to make a Connection Configuration available. Task Description View List of Connection Configuration(s) LOB Admin views available connection configurations, filtered by their assigned line of business. Select Appropriate PROVISIONED Connection LOB Admin selects the provisioned connection to be made available. Test PROVISIONED Connection by checking API LOB Admin tests the selected connection by verifying its API functionality. Connection Successful? Decision point to confirm if the connection test was successful. User makes PROVISIONED Connection AVAILABLE Connection Configuration Published Event If successful, the admin publishes the connection, making it available. System records and completes the publication event, moving the connection to AVAILABLE state. Display message open a ticket for DevOps If unsuccessful, system prompts user to open a support ticket for DevOps intervention. Connection Configuration Intake Process Process returns to intake for troubleshooting and resolution if integration fails. Connection Configuration Decommissioning Process The process of Decommissioning a Connection Configuration starts with the LOB Admin Retiring the Connection Configuration first and then marking it as 'Decommission' in the Resource Manager. Retirement ensures that the Connection Configuration can not be used to create new Resources. After the Connection Configuration is Retired it can be Decommissioned which will only show a message that the API is non-operational. The actual Decommissioning happens outside of ECML. Task Description LOB Admin Login The LOB Admin logs in to the system to manage Connection Configurations. View Connection Configuration Status The LOB Admin views the status of available Connection Configurations. Is Connection Configuration Available? Decision Point: Is the Connection Configuration available for retirement? If No End If no Connection Configuration is available, the process ends. If Yes Select in UI to Retire The LOB Admin selects the Connection Configuration in the UI to retire it. Fire ConnectionConfigurationRetiredEvent The system fires the ConnectionConfigurationRetiredEvent to initiate retirement. Update Connection Configuration Status to 'Retired' The Connection Configuration status is updated to 'Retired'. Is Connection Configuration Retired? Decision Point: Has the Connection Configuration been successfully retired? If No Select in UI to Retire If not retired, the process reverts back to the User to select in the UI to Retire. If Yes Select in UI to Decommission The LOB Admin selects the retired Connection Configuration in the UI to decommission it. Fire ConnectionConfigurationDecommissionedEvent The system fires the ConnectionConfigurationDecommissionedEvent to initiate decommissioning. Display Connection Decommissioned message to user The system displays a message to the user confirming the Connection Configuration is decommissioned. Connection Configuration is Decommissioned The Connection Configuration is fully decommissioned and removed from use for new resources. Connection Configuration Replacement Process The model demonstrates the best practice for replacement of a Connection Configuration that has been or is planned on being Decommissioned. This includes replacing the Connection Configuration's Template Versions and Resource Versions by creating new Versions of each as desired. Additionally, all Resource and Templates Versions that used the old Connection Configuration should be Retired as they are no longer needed. Task Description LoB Admin plans to or already decommissioned a Connection Configuration The LoB Admin identifies a Connection Configuration that is planned for or already decommissioned. Connection Configuration Intake Process The LoB Admin initiates the intake process to evaluate and process the replacement Connection Configuration. Is Connection Configuration Available? Decision Point: Determine if a replacement Connection Configuration is available. If No End Create Resource Version? If no replacement is available, the process ends. Decision Point: Determine if a new Resource Version should be created using the replacement Connection Configuration. If No End If not creating a Resource Version, the process ends. Overall Resource Version Process If yes, initiate the process to create a new Resource Version using the replacement Connection Configuration. New Resource Version is created for Resource using this Replacement Connection Configuration A new Resource Version is created using the replacement Connection Configuration. Create Template Version Subprocess The Changeset Editor initiates the subprocess to create a new Template Version using the new Resource Version. New Template Version is created for Template using the new Resource Version A new Template Version is created for the Template that uses the replacement Connection Configuration. Connection Configuration successfully replaces for Letter Generation The new Connection Configuration is now successfully used for letter generation. Connection Configuration Clean-up Initiate clean-up process for the retired/decommissioned Connection Configuration. Resource Version Retirement Subprocess Template Version Retirement Subprocess Retire ALL Resource Versions that used the retired/decommissioned Connection Configuration. Retire ALL Template Versions that used the retired/decommissioned Connection Configuration. Retired Clean-up Process is complete The process of cleaning up retired Resource and Template Versions is complete. Overall Resource Version Process The model demonstrates the creation, update and retirement of a Resource Version within Resource Manager. Two types of Resources can be added, each requiring testing before they become available for use. Task Description Log in to Resource Manager The LOB Admin logs into the Resource Manager to manage resource versions. View AVAILABLE Connection List The LOB Admin views the list of available connections for resource creation, update, or retirement. Create, Update, or Retire Resource Version? Decision Point: Determine if the action is to create, update, or retire a resource version. Create New Resource Version DRAFT If creating, the LOB Admin initiates a new resource version in DRAFT state. Select Resource Type The LOB Admin selects the type of resource to create (Data or File). Select Data Resource Type For data resources, select the specific data resource type. Select Resource Parameter(s) Input the parameters for the data resource version. Input API Enter API details if required for the resource type. API Test Successful? Decision Point: Test the API with sample values to confirm it works as expected. If No Remains as DRAFT If the API test is unsuccessful, the resource version remains in DRAFT and the user is notified of the error. If Yes Input Resource Type Info If the API test is successful, input resource type information (name, type, path). Test Successful? Decision Point: Test resource type information for success. If No Remains as DRAFT If not successful, the resource version remains in DRAFT and the user is notified of the error. If Yes Make Resource Version AVAILABLE If successful, make the resource version AVAILABLE. Resource Version Draft Completed Event The system triggers the Resource Version Draft Completed Event and moves the resource version to AVAILABLE state. Select File Resource Type For file resources, select the specific file resource type. Add Image or PDF? Decision Point: Determine if the file resource is an image or PDF. Select PDF Select Image Input URL Update If PDF, select the PDF file to add. If image, select the image file to add. Enter the URL for the file resource if required. For updates, select the resource version to modify. Is the Resource Version in DRAFT or AVAILABLE state? Decision Point: Is the resource version in DRAFT or AVAILABLE state? Edit DRAFT Resource Version If DRAFT, edit the resource version details. Resource Version Retirement Subprocess If retiring, initiate the Resource Version Retirement Subprocess. Resource Version is Retired The resource version is retired and no longer available for use. Resource Version Retirement Subprocess This model demonstrates LOB admin viewing list of Resource Versions for a Connection Configuration and retiring each Resource Version which updates the Resource Version to RETIRED state. Retiring the Resource Version ensures no new Resources can be created using this retired Connection Configuration. Task LOB Log in Description The Line of Business (LOB) user logs in to the system. View ALL Connection Configuration The Resource Manager views all available connection configurations. Is Resource Version AVAILABLE? Decision Point: Is the Resource Version available for retirement? If No End If the Resource Version is not available, the subprocess ends. If Yes Select 'Retire' in UI The Resource Manager selects the 'Retire' option for the Resource Version in the UI. Fire ResourceVersionRetiredEvent The system fires the ResourceVersionRetiredEvent to initiate retirement of the Resource Version. Update Resource Version to 'Retired' The system updates the status of the Resource Version to 'Retired'. Check to Verify 'Retired' State The Resource Manager checks to verify that the Resource Version is in 'Retired' state. For Each Resource Version that Uses Old Connection Configuration Repeat the subprocess for each Resource Version that uses the old Connection Configuration. End The Resource Version Retirement subprocess is complete. Create / Update / Retire Workflow This model demonstrates how workflow is created, updated with additional configurations and retired from its AVAILABLE state by LOB Admin. Additional configurations include adding or removing Full Templates and storage and distribution options with Claim Evidence and Package Manager. Claim Evidence is responsible for the storage of Documents and Package Manager accepts request from Claim Evidence to distribute correspondence to the recipient. Task Description Log in to Template Manager The LoB Admin logs into Template Manager. Workflow Exists? Decision Point: The LoB Admin checks to see if the Workflow already exists. No Create New DRAFT Workflow If a Workflow does not exist, the LoB Admin creates a new Workflow in the DRAFT state. Assign Workflow new Name The LoB Admin assigns a new Name to the Workflow. Add Workflow Description (Optional) The LoB Admin adds an optional description for the Workflow Mark Workflow as AVAILABLE LoB Admin marks the Workflow as AVAILABLE. Workflow Created Workflow is created. Workflow Exists? Yes Update or Retire? Update Select AVAILABLE Workflow Select Configurations? (options) Configure Templates The LoB Admin can choose to Update or Retire the Workflow. The LoB Admin selects the AVAILABLE Workflow to update the Configurations. The LoB Admin determines the Configurations they want to update. The LoB Admin selects to configure Templates already added to the Workflow. Here they are able to make the Template, at the Workflow level, Package Manager or Claim Evidence Exempt, and configure it with a Claim Evidence Document Type as needed. Update Name The LoB Admin selects to updates the Workflow Name. Update Key Parameter The LoB Admin selects to updates the Workflow Parameter. Add or Remove Template(s) The LoB Admin selects to Add or Remove Templates. Update Storage The LoB Admin selects to update Storage. Update Distribution The LoB Admin selects to update Distribution.

Workflow Updated After all desired Configuration Updates are performed, the Workflow is updated. Retire Select Workflow The LoB Admin selects the Workflow to be retired. Is Workflow AVAILABLE? Is the selected Workflow AVAILABLE? If Yes Retire Workflow The LoB Admin retires the Workflow. If No Workflow is not Retired Workflow cannot be retired. Overall Changeset Process This model outlines the complete lifecycle of a Changeset from creation to publishing. It illustrates key states, decision points, and transitions across testing, approval, and scheduling. Changeset Editor Swimlane demonstrates the Changeset Editor creates a Changeset first and creates a new Template Version, add an existing Template Version or retire a Template Version. Once all the Template Versions are in COMPLETED state, each Template Version can be tested in the Changeset. Changeset can be submitted for approval when all the Template Versions pass the test scenarios and their status are updated to TESTED. Changeset Editor also creates a new File Version or retires a File Version. Changeset Editor marks the File Version as COMPLETE to submit for approval. Changeset Publisher Swimlane demonstrates Changeset Publisher can approve or reject the Changeset. When the Changeset is approved, it can be scheduled or rescheduled for publishing. Upon publishing, the Changeset Status is updated to PUBLISHED. Overall Changeset Process Changeset Editor Task Description Changeset Editor Creates Changeset Initiate the process by creating a new changeset to manage template and/or file version changes. Assign Name for the Changeset Give the changeset a unique, descriptive name for tracking and identification. Select List View Choose the view mode for managing either template versions or file versions. Decision: Template View or File View? Decide whether the next action involves templates or file versions. Decision: Create a New Template / Existing? In template view, decide to either create a new template or work with an existing template version. Enter Template Name If creating a new template, specify its name. Enter Template Type Select whether the Template Type is a Full or Fragment Template Type. Create New Template Version Subprocess Begin the subprocess to create a new version for a template, entering all required information and details. Add to Changeset (Template) Add the newly created template version to the changeset for further processing. Decision: Add More Templates? Decide whether to add additional template versions to the changeset or proceed. Select Existing Template Version If not creating a new template, select an existing template version for update or retirement. Decision: Is Template Version Locked? Check if the selected template version is locked; if locked, the update process cannot proceed and ends for that item. Create New Version from Existing Template Template Version Retirement Subprocess Add to Changeset (from Retirement /Update) Decision: Are there Template Versions? If not locked, initiate the creation of a new version from the existing template. If retiring, start the subprocess to retire the selected template version. Add template versions (created or retired) to the changeset. Decide if any template versions are present in the changeset to proceed to testing. Mark Changeset as Ready to Test If template versions are present, mark the changeset as ready to begin the testing process. Template Version Testing Subprocess Initiate the subprocess to test each template version in the changeset. Failed scenarios move items back to DRAFT for correction. Decision: All Template Versions in TESTED? Check if all template versions in the changeset have passed testing and reached the TESTED state. Submit Changeset for Approval Once all template versions are tested, submit the changeset for approval by the publisher. File View If file view is selected, manage file versions within the changeset. Decision: Create or Retire File Version? Decide whether to create a new file version or retire an existing file version. Create File Version Subprocess Start the subprocess to create a new file version, including versioning, naming, and validation. File Version Retirement Subprocess Begin the subprocess to retire an existing file version. Add to Changeset (File) Add created or retired file versions to the changeset for processing. Decision: Create Additional File Version? Changeset Publisher Decide whether to create or retire additional file versions or proceed to the next steps in the process. Task Description Changeset Approval Subprocess Review the changeset and approve or reject it. Changeset Scheduling Subprocess Schedule the approved changeset for publication. Changeset Reschedule Event Optionally reschedule the publication of the changeset. Scheduled Date/Time Arrives Monitor until the scheduled date and time for publication arrives. Changeset Scheduled Time Arrived Event Trigger publication when the scheduled time is reached. Changeset is Published Finalize and publish the changeset. Changeset moves to PUBLISHED state Update the status of the changeset, template versions, and file versions to AVAILABLE or RETIRED as appropriate. Create Template Version for Changeset Subprocess This model demonstrates the Changeset Editor creating a Template Version and editing its content as needed. Changeset Editor adds the desired File Version(s) to the Template Version and marks it as COMPLETE so the status of the Template Version updates to COMPLETED state. The Changeset Editor configures the Template Version by either following the Workflow’s existing settings or overriding them for storage and distribution. The Changeset Editor can choose to bypass both Claim Evidence and Package Manager, or use Claim Evidence only by exempting Package Manager. Task Description Create Template Version The process begins with Changeset Editor initiating the creation of a Template Version. Increment Template Version Number The system increases the version number for the Template to reflect the new Version. Add Template Version to Template The system adds the newly created Template Version to the collection of Templates in the system. Edit Template Version Content The Changeset Editor edits and refines the content of the DRAFT Template Version as needed. Add File Version(s) Add AVAILABLE File Version(s) The Changeset Editor wants to add one or more File Version(s) in the AVAILABLE state to the DRAFT Template Version. Mark Template Version as 'Completed' The Changeset Editor marks the Template Version as 'Completed'. Override Storage/Distribution Claim Evidence/Package Manager Exempt or Package Manager Exempt? The Changeset Editor wants to override the storage/distribution. Claim Evidence/Package Manager Exempt or Package Manager Exempt? Decision Point: The Changeset Editor can bypass both Claim Evidence and Package Manager or only Package Manager. If Claim Evidence/Package Manager Exempt Mark as 'Claim Evidence and Package Manager Exempt' The Changeset Editor marks the Template Version as 'Claim Evidence and Package Manager Exempt. Documents will be stored in CE only if the Workflow is configured to use CE. Package Manager is automatically exempt in this situation. If Package Manager Exempt Mark as 'Package Manager Exempt' The Changeset Editor marks the Template Version as 'Package Manager Exempt'. Documents will be stored in CE only if the Workflow is configured with both CE and Package Manager. Template Version Draft Complete Event The Template Draft Completed Event is triggered. *Template Version moves to COMPLETED state Template Version and File Version Retirement Subprocess Template Version and File Version retirement is a stand-alone process, but also integral to the Connection Configuration Replacement process and Overall Changeset process. This model demonstrates Changeset Editor selecting an AVAILABLE Template Version or File Version, and invoking the changes its status to RETIRED and remove it from active use. Retirement Action , which To Retire all Versions of a Template or File at once, the Changeset Editor can create a Changeset with Retirement Actions only. Task Description Changeset Editor starts Retirement Action The Changeset Editor logs in to Template Manager to start the Retirement Action User Selects AVAILABLE Template Version(s) or File Version(s) Changeset Editor selects AVAILABLE Template Version(s) or File Version(s) to retire. User Selects 'Retire' in UI The Changeset Editor selects to retire the Template Version. Add to Changeset The Changeset Editor adds the Template Version(s) or File Version(s) to the Changeset Create DRAFT Retirement Action Template Manager creates a DRAFT Retirement Action containing the Template Version(s) or File Version(s) selected to be retired. Add DRAFT Retirement Action to the Changeset Template Manager adds the Retirement Action to the Changeset. Mark Retirement Action as Complete The Changeset Editor marks the Retirement Action as Complete. Retirement Action Complete Event The Retirement Action Complete Event is fire, and the Retirement Action moves to COMPLETED state. Template Version Testing Subprocess This model demonstrates how the Changeset Editor creates new or selects existing test scenario to validate Template Versions, ensuring they render the correct PDF with appropriate changes. Upon successful completion of all test scenarios, the Changeset Editor marks them as TESTED, which transitions the Changeset to a TESTED state. Test Scenarios are created for specific Template Versions, and are used inside of Changesets to test them, but live outside of the Changeset, and can be re-used by future Changesets to regression test changes to those Templates. Task Description User COMPLETED Template Version to Test Do Test Scenarios for the Template Version Exist? If No Create New Test Scenario for Template Version The process starts when the Changeset Editor has a COMPLETED Template Version that they want to test. Decision Point: determine if Test Scenario(s) already exist for the Template Version. If Test Scenario(s) do not already exist, the Changeset Editor creates a new Test Scenario for the Template Version. If Yes View Existing Test Scenarios for Template Version If Test Scenario(s) exist, the Changeset Editor view the existing Test Scenario (s) for the Template Version. Select Test Scenario The Changeset Editor selects the appropriate Test Scenario to work with. Enter Fields in Selected Test Scenario The Changeset Editor enters the required fields for the selected Test Scenario. If New Test Scenario Show Rendered Sample PDF If the Test Scenario is new, the system renders and displays the sample PDF. If Existing Test Scenario Show Side by Side Comparison Between PDF Renders of This Version and Last Version If there are existing Test Scenario(s), the system shows a side-by-side comparison of current and previous PDF Template Versions. PDF Meet Expectations Decision point: do the results of the PDF meet the Changeset Editor's expectations? If Yes Mark Test Scenario as Passed If yes, mark the Test Scenario as PASSED. Test Scenario Passed Event The system records the Template Version Tests Passed event. Are Additional Test Scenario(s) needed? Decision Point: Determine if additional testing is needed. If Yes Go back to check if Test Scenario(s) exist If No Mark Template Version Tested If yes, go back to check if the Test Scenario exists and continue through the steps. If no additional Test Scenario(s) are needed, the Changeset Editor marks the Template Version as TESTED. Template Version Tests Passed Event The system records the Template Version Tests Passed event. Template Version Moves to Tested State The Template Version moves to the TESTED state. If No Mark Test Scenario as Failed Test Scenario Failed Event Create File Version Subprocess If no, mark the Test Scenario as FAILED. The Changeset Editor loops back for further action. The system records the Test Scenario Failed event and moves the Test Scenario to DRAFT state. The Create File Version Subprocess allows a Changeset Editor to create and prepare a new file version for inclusion in a changeset. The process includes versioning, naming, file selection and validation, and setting the file version to a completed state once requirements are met. Task Description Increment File Version The system increments the file version number for a new file version entry. Enter File Version Name The editor enters a unique name for the new file version. Browse File(s) The editor browses and selects the file(s) to be added (PDF or image). Add PDF / Add Image The editor uploads either a PDF or an image, as determined by file selection. Validate File Type The system validates the uploaded file is a correct PDF or image; errors prompt user action. Mark File Version as COMPLETED Once validation passes, the editor marks the file version as completed. File Version Draft Completed Event The file version is updated to the COMPLETED state and is ready for further workflow steps. Changeset Approval Subprocess This model demonstrates the Changeset Publisher reviewing the TESTED Template Versions, the Retirement Actions and File Versions within the Changeset to approve or reject them. Once all the Template Versions, Retirement Actions and File Versions are approved, the Changeset Publisher approves the entire Changeset so that the status of the Changeset updates to APPROVED state. Changeset Publisher rejects the Changeset if the Publisher doesn't approve the changes for the Template Versions, Retirement Actions or File Versions. The Changeset get's recalled back to the DRAFT state and corrections are made by the Changeset Editor before submitting for approval again. Changeset Approval Subprocess Changeset Publisher Task Select Changeset Description Publisher selects the changeset to review and approve. Is Changeset Approval Required? Decision point to determine if approval is needed for the changeset. Review Template Versions If template versions exist, publisher reviews each one in the changeset. Review File Versions If file versions exist, publisher reviews each one in the changeset. Review Retirement Actions If the changeset contains retirement actions, publisher reviews each one. Mark Changeset as APPROVED If all versions/actions are approved, publisher marks the changeset as APPROVED. Mark Changeset as REJECTED If any version/action is not approved, publisher marks the changeset as REJECTED and provides a reason. Changeset Approval Process Complete Event Publisher completes the approval process, transitioning the changeset to the APPROVED state. Changeset Rejected Event Publisher completes the rejection process, transitioning the changeset to the REJECTED state. Are all Template Versions, File Versions, and Retirement Actions approved? Decision to confirm full approval before moving to final state. Template Version Approval Subprocess Task Description Select Template Version Publisher selects each template version in the changeset for review. Review content in Template Version Publisher reviews the content and details of the template version. Is the Template Version APPROVED? Decision point to approve or reject the template version. Mark Template Version as APPROVED If approved, publisher marks the template version as APPROVED. Provide Reason If rejected, publisher provides a reason for rejection. Template Version Approval Completed Event Publisher completes approval/rejection for each template version. Retirement Action Approval Subprocess Task Description Select Retirement Action Publisher selects each retirement action in the changeset for review.

Mark Retirement Action as APPROVED If approved, publisher marks the retirement action as APPROVED. Provide Reason If rejected, publisher provides a reason for rejection. Retirement Action Approval Completed Event Publisher completes approval/rejection for each retirement action. File Version Approval Subprocess Task Description Select COMPLETED File Version Publisher selects each file version in the changeset for review. Review File Version Publisher reviews the details and content of the file version. Is the File Version APPROVED? Decision point to approve or reject the file version. Mark File Version as APPROVED If approved, publisher marks the file version as APPROVED. Provide Reason If rejected, publisher provides a reason for rejection. File Version Approval Completed Event Publisher completes approval/rejection for each file version. Changeset Editor Task Description Recall Changeset to DRAFT state for corrections Editor recalls the rejected changeset for modifications. Select Changeset for corrections Editor selects the recalled changeset to begin making necessary corrections. Make corrections to Template Versions Editor modifies or updates template versions as required. Make corrections to Retirement Actions Editor modifies or updates retirement actions as required. Make corrections to File Versions Editor modifies or updates file versions as required. Are all Template Versions and File Versions complete? Decision to check if everything is updated and complete. Mark Changeset as Ready to Test If complete, editor marks the changeset as ready for testing. Template Version Testing Subprocess Editor initiates testing for updated template versions. Are all Template Versions in TESTED state? Decision to check if all template versions have passed testing. Changeset contains Template Versions? Decision to check if the changeset has template versions. Changeset Submitted for Approval Event Editor submits the finalized changeset for approval. Changeset moves to READY FOR APPROVAL state Changeset status is updated to indicate it is ready for publisher review. Changeset Scheduling Subprocess This model demonstrates the Changeset Publisher scheduling the Changeset for publication and notifying business stakeholders of the scheduled date. Should rescheduling be necessary, the Changeset Publisher can update the publication date accordingly. Task Description Changeset Publisher Schedules Changeset The Changeset Publisher selects an APPROVED Changeset to schedule for publishing. Enter Date to Schedule The Changeset Publisher enters the desired date/time to schedule the Changeset. Changeset Scheduled Previously? Decision Point: Has the Changeset been scheduled previously? If No Changeset Publishing Planned Event If not previously scheduled, the Changeset Publishing Planned Event is triggered and the Changeset moves to SCHEDULED state. If Yes Changeset Rescheduled Event If already scheduled, a Changeset Rescheduled Event is triggered; Changeset remains in SCHEDULED state. Notify Business The business stakeholders are notified of the scheduled date/time for publishing the Changeset. Business Notified The notification process is complete; business stakeholders have been informed. Letter Finalization Process This model illustrates how Letters are reviewed, approved and Finalized. The Letter Editor Swimlane demonstrates the Letter Editor's capabilities for managing Letter Instances - creating new ones, modifying existing ones, and deleting as needed. New letters automatically utilize the most recent AVAILABLE Template Version to generate DRAFT PDF, while edits to existing letters prompt users with an option to upgrade to newer Templates or maintain their current version. Once the Letter Editor completes their work and marks the letter as READY FOR REVIEW, the system updates its status to READY FOR REVIEW state. The Letter Finalizer Swimlane demonstrates the Letter Finalizer reviewing the Letter marked as READY FOR REVIEW to finalize it so the Letter is updated to FINALIZED status. Rejected Letters revert to DRAFT state for revision. Letter Editor Task Description User logs in to Letter Manager Letter Editor logs into the Letter Manager to manage Letter Instance(s). View List of Letter Instance(s) Displays Letter Instance(s), highlighting those with retired or outdated Template Versions. Create New, Update Existing, or Delete Letter Instance? Decision Point: Choose to create, update, or delete a Letter Instance.

Long-Term Provenance Letter Instance Provenance refers to the ability to chronicle how a Letter Instance was created, i.e., by whom, and when, while also tracing the origins of every element, including configured content as well as all data values input. A Letter Instance is derived from a Template Version, thus maintaining a comprehensive record of the Template Version, from which it was derived, including the Template Version’s unique content and the Resource Version(s) it used, will ensure traceability of all the configured content. Chronicling the data input ensures the verifiable origin of the data necessary for auditing and validation purposes. For all data fields, the record will log the data/time of input, the source of data (e.g., the Resource Version from which the data originated (API or URL) or user, if manually input), and the actual data values entered in the Letter Instance. The diagram below illustrates how each data element depicted in the Letter Instance (Orange, Red, Yellow) can be traced to its origin. For example, the Data Structure input in the Letter Instance can be traced to the Orange Resource (configured in the Template Version) which used a Connection Configuration to API #1 to access the data used to populate the Letter Instance. The Data File can be traced to the Red Resource (configured in the Template Version) which accessed the Data File from API #2 via the Connection Configuration and Other Data can be traced to the User who manually input the data in the Letter Instance. Security Strategy ECM-L is heavily dependent on policies concerning authentication and authorization and will utilize the enefits pplication uthori ation framework (BAAZ) as the propagation mechanism for an LOB’s authorization policies. BAAZ is a policy framework that uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) with a central policy store where LOBs can manage their own policies and any application can create its own policies and apply policies that are managed by a central security authority and appropriately audited. ( capabilities for maintaining their own governance and security policies. An important part of the Intake Process will be for each LOB to establish a set of policies for that LOB, including policies for access to Applications and Workflows. ). As an enterprise system, LOBs will have self-service See Benefit Applications Authorization Services A B A Z Recommendation Analysis of Alternatives Based on comprehensive analysis across technical, business, and operational dimensions, comparing the ECM-L solution against a solution making use of the Salesforce Platform, the recommendation is to proceed with this custom development approach to best meet the business's needs. This recommendation is supported by the following key findings: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
